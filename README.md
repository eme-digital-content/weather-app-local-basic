# My Weather APP

It's a basic Weather App, developed using .hmtl, css, and .js files.
The App was my final project for SheCodes plus course.

Using **My Weather App**, you can check the current weather in any city around the world and the weather in your location through the *Current Location* button, as well as the forecast for the next five days.
