# My Weather APP - SheCodes Plus

It's a basic Weather App, developed using .hmtl, css, and .js files. The App was my final project for the SheCodes Plus course.

Using **My Weather App**, you can check:

- The current weather in any city around the world through the search bar.
- The current weather in your location through the _Current Location_ button.
- The current weather in five "popular" cities.
- The forecast for the next five days.
