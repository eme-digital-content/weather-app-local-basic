# My Weather APP

It's a basic Weather App, developed using .hmtl, css, and .js files.
The App was my final project for SheCodes Plus course.

Using **My Weather App**, you can check:

- The current weather in any city around the world through the search bar.
- The current weather in your location through the *Current Location* button.
- The forecast for the next five days. 

Let me know if you have any questions or comments :)
